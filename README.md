# Likelihood-of-Concussion-Reporting
The objective of the project was to utilize the Concussion Survey, which collected feedback from individuals regarding their likelihood of reporting injuries, to develop insights into the underlying reasons that lead to injury reporting for different meaningful groups. To achieve this, I employed two overarching methods: Factor Analysis and Cluster Analysis. The ultimate aim of the project is to propose solutions for increasing concussion reporting likelihood for one or more meaningful groups of young adults.Â
